      <description>Introduction Hello GB friends, I&amp;rsquo;m Seven. I wanted to write an article on probabilities for certain decisions that are common in Green Blue. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing ramp decks (mainly DKP RB), a couple of sets, and with these kind of decks relying so much on chance to draw ramp and some key cards, I believe that is key to delegate certain decisions to probability.
I like to think about a card game as you would for a chess game for the most part.</description>
