      <description>40% ortholinear keyboard  Last time I discovered the wonderful world of QMK and keyboard firmware customization. If you remember, we went onto how important it is to feel comfortable using your keyboard, specially when it&amp;rsquo;s your work tool. I teased this post with a question that said: &amp;ldquo;could I go even smaller?&amp;rdquo;. And so, even smaller I went.

This is my new keyboard, it&amp;rsquo;s a 40% ortholinear keyboard and it&amp;rsquo;s my new daily driver.</description>

      <description>As you may have realized based on my previous post, I&amp;rsquo;m really into improving my efficiency when it comes to programming and using the keyboard in general. That&amp;rsquo;s why I got into Vim and that&amp;rsquo;s why now I&amp;rsquo;m into keyboard stuff.
When I was little I remember my dad teaching me to touch type, we didn&amp;rsquo;t even have a computer at home, but my dad thought it was important for me to learn to use a keyboard and brought an old typewriter home.</description>
